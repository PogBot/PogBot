As the creator of PogBot, I can say, he is not always working.
Yeah, he is like almost 100% of the time but there's that
little slither of time where he's not working and I catch him
off-guard and not working. Luckily for me, the users of PogBot
help report his errors. By alerting me, I can recognise the
errors quicker than if it was just me, so - a massive thank
you to the Pogchamps out there who help PogBot day by day,
and you reading this, I hope you can become a PogChamp!
