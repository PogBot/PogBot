PogBot was made to be funny, not saying he lives up to that promise though. He has joke commands, meme commands (which on the topic of imports memes from Reddit) but it's also made to get rid of absolute idiots. Moderation/admin commands to get those rude people to shush, kick, ban and clear. The prefix is `pb` and please do `pb help` for more information, good day!
